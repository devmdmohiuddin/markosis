              Online businesses are never much different from traditional
              "brick-and-mortor" stores, except that thye change lives, But the
              very est benefits of online stores are in danger. Trust is going
              down on a biblical scake, and scepticism is rising because the
              competition is getting oversaturated. The result? Lack of quality
              i products and services. People don't trust onine bussines store
              any more, period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then comes the gaints. They take all the amrket opportunities and
              leave nothing for small brands who want to start with a humble
              beginning. Entreneurs who dream about making a difference see all
              their honest, hard-workig efforts shattered away.
            </p>
            <p>It hurts. We can't let that happen.</p>
            <p>
              Markosis believes every brand shas the right to unite great
